//Arranging coins 

You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.

Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.

n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

n = 5

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.


//Solution

class Solution {
    public int arrangeCoins(int n) {
        long low=1,high=n,ans=0;
        while(low<=high){
            long mid=(low+high)/2;
            long midsq=(mid*(mid+1))/2;
            if(midsq==n){
                return (int)mid;
            }
            else if(midsq>n){
                high=mid-1;
            }
            else{
                low=mid+1;
                ans=mid;
            }
        }
        return (int)ans;
    }
}
